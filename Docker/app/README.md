What Is This?
-------------

This is a simple Python/Flask application intended to provide a working example of Uber's external API. The goal of these endpoints is to be simple, well-documented, and to provide a base for developers to develop other applications from.

How To Use This
---------------

1. Navigate to https://developer.uber.com/ and sign up for an Uber developer account.
2. Register a new Uber application and make your Redirect URI `http://localhost:7000/submit` - ensure that both the `profile` and `history` OAuth scopes are checked.
3. Fill in the relevant information in the `config.json` file in the root folder and add your client ID and secret as the environment variables `UBER_CLIENT_ID` and `UBER_CLIENT_SECRET`.
4. Run `export UBER_CLIENT_ID="`*{your client ID}*`"&&export UBER_CLIENT_SECRET="`*{your client secret}*`"`
5. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.
6. Run `python app.py`.
7. Navigate to http://localhost:7000 in your browser.

Testing
-------

1. Install the dependencies with `make bootstrap`.
2. Run the command `make test`.
3. If you delete the fixtures or decide to add some of your own, you’ll have to re-generate them, and the way this is done is by running the app, getting an auth_token from the main page of the app. Paste that token in place of the `test_auth_token` at the top of the `test_endpoints.py` file, then run the tests.

Development
-----------

If you want to work on this application, we’d love your pull requests and tickets on GitHub!

1. If you open a ticket, please make sure it describes the problem or feature request fully.
2. If you send us a pull request, make sure you add a test for what you added, and ensure the full test suite runs with `make test`.

Deploy to Heroku
----------------

Click the button below to set up this sample app on Heroku:

After creating your app on Heroku, you have to configure the redirect URL for your Uber OAuth app. Use `https://`*{your-app-name}*`.herokuapp.com/submit` URL. You will also want to configure the Heroku environment variable `FLASK_DEBUG=False` in order to properly serve SSL traffic.
