# Connecting to Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

When you're deploying locally, without any CI/CD to EKS, you'll need to authenticate from your local terminal.

Once you authenticate to EKS from your local terminal, a `kubeconfig` gets stored on your computer. The `kubeconfig` has all of the connection information and authentication needed to connect to EKS.

## Connecting to EKS

1. Run the following command to connect to EKS:
`aws eks --region *your_aws_region* update-kubeconfig --name *your_eks_cluster_name*`

2. Once connected, you should be able to run commands like the following to confirm you're connected:
`kubectl get nodes`
