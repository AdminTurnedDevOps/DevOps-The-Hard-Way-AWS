# Create The Kubernetes Manifest

At this point you have successfully created a Docker image from the Uber app and stored it in ACR.

Now it's time to set up the Kubernetes manifest, which will take the application and deploy it to AKS.

## The Manifest

The Kubernetes manifest will consist of two components:
- The deployment
- The service
- The Application Gateway Ingress

The deployment is what gets the application running in Kubernetes

The service is what exposes the Kubernetes application so you can, for example, reach the frontend from a load balancer hostname or IP.

The manifest can be found in the `kubernetes_manifest` directory. Ensure on line `31` to change the image URL to the one you have in your Azure account.
