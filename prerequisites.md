# Prerequisites

## Prior Knowledge In Tech

DevOps isn't an entry level role by any means if it's being done correctly. There's a lot of knowledge you need prior, including:
- Some sort of cloud engineering/cloud knowledge experience. Although not all environments are running in the cloud, most of these roles will want it.
- Scripting/automation/programming experience. You don't have to go out and write the next Twitter, but you should understand the basics of programming.
- Network, storage, and compute knowledge.
- Held a prior systems administration, infrastructure engineer, or cloud engineer role.

## Azure

### Create An Azure Account

To follow along with this tutorial, you should have an Azure account. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for a free 12 month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/search/?&ef_id=Cj0KCQjwtrSLBhCLARIsACh6RmiaUvnIcRuC0BE8HVqtnC09Za6Y_ByYHH8Z4qHmK5-inXXdgZB3d1EaAh8EEALw_wcB:G:s&OCID=AID2200274_SEM_Cj0KCQjwtrSLBhCLARIsACh6RmiaUvnIcRuC0BE8HVqtnC09Za6Y_ByYHH8Z4qHmK5-inXXdgZB3d1EaAh8EEALw_wcB:G:s&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtrSLBhCLARIsACh6RmiaUvnIcRuC0BE8HVqtnC09Za6Y_ByYHH8Z4qHmK5-inXXdgZB3d1EaAh8EEALw_wcB).

You should know that the tutorial for *DevOps The Hard Way* will cost money because some of the services that you use in Azure will not be part of the free tier.

To learn more about the Azure Pricing Model so you understand what the cost will be, you can go [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/pricing/calculator/)

### Use the Azure CLI

The Azure CLI is a way for you to interact with all Azure services at a programmatic level using the terminal.

To set this up, follow the directions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

## Installations
You will need to download some software and services for this tutorial.

### Code Editor

Because code will be written for *DevOps The Hard Way*, you will need a code editor. For the purposes of this tutorial, you can use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), which is a free code editor.

### Terraform

[Terraform Download](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) - Tested on version 1.1.7

### Docker
To build the Docker image, you can use Docker Desktop for Windows or MacOS.
